# Edu's Library

## A win-win project

I've started this project mainly with the plain purpose of creating a huuuge library system that could possibly work in some places that I attend. But seeing this gave me an idea, **_before organizing other's people books, I should manage my own personal library first..._**. While organizing my stuff, a friend of mine [Luiz](https://github.com/lffg) told me about a new ORM called [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) which proved to be very easy to use, with a pleasant syntax and smart database management.

It might take a while to finish, but stay tuned!



# Application
I've decided to make this project a server-side rendering application, thus I used [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) view-engine to render pages. About security I've chosen to the traditional way with cookies ([here's why](https://gist.github.com/lemosep/b93d3ea7cb2f773be0d630a7c6f1db0b)) being sent to the browser and a JWT token being store both the server and the cookie. Authentication was a new thing to me, so learning it was hard whilst fun.
